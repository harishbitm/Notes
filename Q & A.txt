Q) what is shoft link and hard link
Q) How to copy file to docker container
    docker cp /source /destination :- can copy local to container and viseversa 
	
Q) how to expose contaier publicly 
     docker run -it -p hostport:containerport --name jenkins imageid
     docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --name jenkins imageid
	
	defference between expose and publish
	  
	  expose :- while exposed ports can only be accessed internally,
	  publish :-  published ports can be accessible by external containers and services.
	  Whereas publishing a port using either -P or -p exposes it, exposing a port using EXPOSE or –expose does not publish it. 
	  
   there are two ways to expose port 
   1. By writing a EXPOSE cmd in Docker file (EXPOSE 8080)
      By default, the EXPOSE instruction does not expose the container’s ports to be accessible from the host. 
	  In other words, it only makes the stated ports available for inter-container interaction.    
   2. By writing a expose flag at run time string (docker run -it --expose=8080 imageid) 
       by useing this flag a range of ports can be exposed 
	   
	there are two ways to publish port
   1. -P (upper case) Using the -P flag at runtime lets you publish all exposed ports to random ports on the host interfaces.
       It’s short for –publish-all.
   2. -p (lower case) Using the -p flag at runtime lets you publish a container’s specific port(s) to the Docker host. 
      It’s short for –publish.

Q) ECR and ECS
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes easy to store, manage, deploy Docker container images. 
Amazon ECR is integrated with Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), simplifying your development to production workflow
   
   will go to ECR and will create a repository, will have commands to push & pull docker container images to the repository
    
   Q) How did you registor a regestory in ECR 
   
   Q)
       
   
Q) what is the defference between registory and repository
  registory is a type of software to store the repositors (ex:- ECR, JFROG), where as repository is a file system which conntains set of files
	
Q) what is defference b/w CMD & Entery point 
  *CMD is default instruction which is exicuted when we run container out of image, cmd can be overreaded,
   when we give multiple cmd it will consider only last cmd in docker file.
  
  *Enterypoint can not be overreaded during run time
  
 **CMD instruction can be overreaded during run time but entrypoint can not be overreaded during run time, entery point can be apened with the
   argument given in the docker file
    
Q) what is docker compoise 
   when we need to run multiple container at a time we will use docker compose, it is advanced version of docker file 

Q) docker swarm
Q) what is vertulzation and containerzation


Q) what is the default values of fallowing
    umask value for root user = 0022  (usermask)
	umask value for ec2 user  = 0002 
	base permissions for file = 0666
	base permission for directory = 0777
	
	default directory permissions for root = 755  
	default file permission for root = 644
	
	defult directory permission for ec2 user = 775
	default file permission for ec2 user     = 664
	
   *values of read = 4 wright = 2   exgute = 1  "rwx"
	
   *three sets will be there "owner group exicuted" as shown as "dr- xr- x---" respectivly

   *if you want to fimd existing permissions of any file use command "ls -l"

	*how to change umask value permanently spacific user
	 need add umask value to .bash_profile
	*how to change umask value permanently for all user 
	 need add umask value to etc/profile file

	 * if u want to create directory with required permissions
	  cmd "mkdir -m 700 directory name "  (-m = more, -p = parent, -v = verbus"

	chown newuser:newgroupname file/directory
	
	Mostly issues come at the time of build creation 
1- unable to clone code from SCM
2- cloning takes a lot time
3- Server runs out of space 
4- unable to copy data to destination server
5- ssh connection times out etc.

  Q) if acording to organiztion police if SSH conectivity is not allowd to connect ansible server and other nodes, what will you do
     Ans) will use other tools which not required shh like chef and puppet 
	                                or
	   http and https connectivity is allowed between servers, for expample number of users as to be created and packages has to be updated 
	   or users has to be blocked we need to change DNS settings we will allow configurations of the all the servers to be keept in the
       centralised repositors this configuration will be called to all the servers using http and https  

  Q) how do you scure your docker images, 
  Q) what is docker registory, difference between public and private registory, in which cases will use public regitory and private registory (repository)  
  Q) if you wright docker file, what are all the inputs you need from devloper and viseversa
  Q) what is cgroup, namespaces and UFS 
  Q) what is the loglevel, and where we can change the loglevel and where we use logleveal in defferent logleveal enveronment   
  Q) how to create private subnet by default 
   ans) genrally while creating vpc inernet gateway has been associtaed with main rout table but in this case we have to create route table 
        and netgateway, this both has to be associtaed and this new route table need to be make it has main route table then if we create
        subnet it will be private by default
  Q) what are the automation tools you have worked with 
       ansible and teraform 
  Q) what are the defference between application load balancer and network ELB 
     Application load balancer 
	 if we need to load balance only hhtp and https trafic then i am going to use application load balancer because based on  that 
	 we can implement multipale rules like based on path, host, multipale defferent parametters based on sourse and multipale rules 
	 placed on application. in application load balancer we have target groups 
	 
	 Network load balancer
	 if we want to balance load based on TCP, UDP & TLS  then we have to use network load balancer.
	 in network load balancer we can not place security group as well as multiplae rules like application load balancer 
  Q) what is role in ansible
  
  Q) To access kernel information about process
  Q) which Command compares 2 specified branches in git
  Q) how to change master branch in git 
        or 
     how to point master branch to new branch in git 
     ans)  
	 1 ) Renamed master branch to oldmaster.

          [shell]git branch -m master oldmaster[/shell]


          Now there is no master branch on my local machine.

     2) Renamed my masterTemp branch to master

          [shell]git branch -m masterTemp master[/shell]

           The branch which was named masterTemp on my local machine is now master

     3) Delete the branch from remote

          [shell]git branch -rD master[/shell]

     4) Push the new master branch to remote

          [shell]git push –force origin master[/shell]
		  
	Q) which protocal that ping use ?  
	ans) ICMP (Internet control message protocal)
	
	Q) what is softlink and hardlink 
	
	  *softlink is nothing but crating a shortcut to a file, this shortcut file will have different inode number and file size is small 
	   when compared to original file, if original file deleted the short link will become useless. however softlink dont store the content 
	   of original file it just store the location of the original file 
	     "ln -s original_filename softlink_filename"
	   
	  *hardlink is creating a copy of file with defferent name, this hardlink file will have same inode number and file size as original
       if original file or hardlink file content has modefied it is going to change in other file also, if original has deleted hardlink 
       file will not be deleted.  
          	   "ln original_filename hardlink_filename"
	   
	  *what is inode
	   Every file in the system will have index node called inode, inode contains the information of a file like inode number, file size,
	   owner information, permission, file type, number of links etc and inode number will not contain file name and file content.   
	     "ls -li" it will show inode number
