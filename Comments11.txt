    reset will undo the changes in the file and it will remove the commits
    revert will undo the chnages in the file but it will not delete the commit_id, it will create a new commit_id

    where to use reset and revert 
	rest is used when comments are in local 
    rest is used when we want to undo the changes of file which is not pushed into the central repository (present in local repository)
    revert is used when we want undo the changes of file which is in central repository
