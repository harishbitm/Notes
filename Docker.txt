apt-get update
get.docker.com
   This script is meant for quick & easy install via:
   #   $ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
   #   $ sh get-docker.sh
  after installing need to give user permission
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER  
  sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
image = tar file = zip file 
docker pull ubuntu
docker images
docker pull centos
docker run -it imageID :- (it = interacrive terminal) It will creat container
docker run -itd imageid :- it will creat continer but it will not go inside continer
docker exec -it continerid /bin/bashm :- cmd used to enter into continer so that u can come out by typing exit without stoping continer   
exit :- it will stop container 
docker start continerID
docker ps :- it will view running continer
docker ps -a :- To view all continers
docker attch continerID :- to get into the continer
ctr+pq :- it will come out from continer without stoping
docker stop continerID :- it will stop continer
docker rename oldname newname
docker run -it --name icici-prod2 imageID (@30min) :- it will creat a continer with requred name 
docker restart continerid
docker -rm containerid  :- remove
docker rm containerid -f
docker rm $(docker ps -aq) -f :- it will remove running continer
docer ps -aq :- view only continer id
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
docker rmi imageID :- remove image 
docker images -q:- only images id
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
can we remove a running container :- yes we can but not recmended

note :-
       N number of continers can be created by using one images 
   ****** Docker-3
Docker build -t imagename .:- (-t=tag, "."= if your in same path u have to give "."  if not need menstion path) = Docker file to Docker image 
Docker run -it imageID = Docker image to Docker container
How to creat docker file

 RUN apt-get update
 ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractve
 RUN apt-get install git maven -y
 RUN apt-get install wget -y 
 RUN wget linkaddres 
 RUN cd /opt/ && wget linkaddres (to run two commands use && symbole)
 EXPOSE 80 :- to provide port number to continer
 COPY :- to copy data in server 
 ADD  :- to get data from external or can use wget
 WORKDIR /temp/   :-it is used if u want to save container in any pertiqular directory 
 
 docker tag imagename imagenamebackup:-  it will take backup (copy) total image 
 
 {sudo usermod -a -g docker $USER
 sudo chmod 666  /var/run/docker.sock} by this two commands we can use user without sudo 
 
     ************** Docker-4************
 consepts :- 1.portmaping
             2.taking backup of images and continers
             3.pusing data into the dockerhub			 
 docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --name jenkins imageid  (-p 8080:8080 it is port maping consept)
 docker commit continerid namebackup
 docker inspect :- to view docker information
 docker logs continerid :- to view last actvitys of continer 
 docker rename oldname newname :-to change imagename 
 docker tag continername newname :- to take backup of a continer (it will creat image as backup)
 
 how to push backup images into dockerhub 
 1:-take backup of continer as same name as shown in dockerhub
 2:- it will creat docker image
 3:- login into docker in server with dockerhub credentials
 4:- push image into Docker hub

 1:-docker commit b960d1a8af5b harishbitm/prodection01backup
 2:-docker images
 3:-docker login
 4:-docker push harishbitm/prodection01backup
 Q) can we increse & decrese the instance type (CPU) :-yes
Q) can we increse & decrese the disc volume   :-incresing is posobale but not posibale to decresing
     how to increse CPU storage
	 * stop server
	 *Action --> instance settings --->instance type
Q) difference bettwen stop & kill & posh
   docker stop continerid :-it eill stop continer 
   docker kill continerid :- if continer has strucked will use this command to came back  	 
   
     *************** Docker-5********
  COMPOSE:- To run multi continer at a time 
  
  SWARM :- it will disturbute single task to multipale continer, this multipale continer can be installed in multipale servers, 
           it will manage group of server and enshore tha higher avilability of application 
       process:-swarm should be insalised in main server it will genrate a token it shoud be coped to other server 
   comments
   * sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr serverIP  :-first need to instialsie 
   * it will genarate token copy that token to other node (server)
   * docker node ls  :- it will list all node (server) conected to master
   * docker network ls :- it list all network 
     note :- * bridge is used to communicate between continers with in server 
             * ingerss (overlay network) used to commincate with other server, ingers will form after intialiging svarm  
   *docker swarm :- it will list commends used in swarm
   
   steps
   1. lanch 3 instances, 1 for master, 2 for nodes 
   2. install docker in all server 
   3. intialise docker swarm in master it will genrate token :- sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr serverIP
   4. copy that token to other nodes 
   5. in master if you type docker node ls :- it will list all nodes conected master 
   6. chnage host name like master, node1 and node2 of all servers by sudo vi etc/hostname and restart server to reset name  :- to avoid confusion 
   7. in master if you type docker network ls :- it will show all networks (bridge and overlay)
   8. docker pull nginx 
   9. docker service create --replicas 3 -p 80:80 --name=service1 nginx  :- craet service (continer) main commend to create a service 
      a) service create - to create service 
	  a) --replicas means Dublication or copys 
	  b) -p 80:80 for port maping 
	  c) --name=sevice1 
	  d) nginx is image name 
	      *docker service ls :- to least services
		  *docker service ps service1 :- to know indetail of replicas of any service 
   10. check nginx status in web by ipaddres and port number 80
   11. docker service ps service1 :- to know detail information of any service 
   12. docker service scale service1=6 :- to increas and decrese continers for perticuler service 
       
	   To update any service by new versions 
	 1. docker pull nginx:1.14.0 :- dounload new version as image  
	 2. docker images 
	 3. docker service update --image imagename(nginx:1.14.0) service1  
   
   13.To exit a server from a docker swarm group use command "docker swamr leave" in node server 
       To remove node in master node list (docker node ls) use command "docekr node rm hostname" 
   14.To stop service " docker service rm servicename"
   
   compose (writen in yaml) (D5@45min) 
   1. install docker compose
      https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-docker-compose-on-ubuntu-18-04
   2. craete docker compose file 
      sudo vi docker-compose.yml
      docker compose file for mysql and wordpress in web to get code to create docker compose file:- https://docs.docker.com/samples/wordpress/
   3. docker-compose up  :- run docker compose file 
       
   
   
   
 Q)how to find swarm token of master 
 
 
 docker permission denied 
 sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
 sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
